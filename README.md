Sprout Synopsis:


What's the goal?

It is an absolute fact that there is a large amount of stress harbored within EPS's student body. Whether it be stress from home, relationships, or academics, stress is pervasive and greatly affects overall student wellbeing. Thankfully, we have counselors who can help assist with stress control and the reinforcement of mental fortitude. However, oftentimes the times where students experience the most stress is away from school, or it can be difficult to bring themselves to meet with the counselors. 


How are we going to accomplish this?

Understanding these issues, Sprout aims to create a stress-help app that provides students with temporary and consistent stress relief through professional advice and personalized recommendations. When entering the website, students will be prompted with a slider to determine their stress level, and after they place their feeling of stress on said scale, they will be prompted with professional recommendations to assist in devaluing said level. If students want to tailor the experience and recommendations, they will be able to make an account in order to filter out specific recommendations and heighten the chances of other ones being recommended. However, this is just the base of this project; there are many more steps we will take.

For starters, Sprout will also be implementing a homework time prediction module, which will be able to predict the amount of time students will need to spend on a specific homework assignment through real student data and machine learning principles. We have support from Mr. Briggs and access to EPSchedule and Canvas, so this will be something we will move toward in the future.

The implementation of a daily log-in system regarding the website. We will have a section which preaches daily mindfulness, exercises, and users will be rewarded for de-stressing daily. Rewards might be a little sprout mascot who grows if the user logs in consistently (hence the name, Sprout).

But this is just the beginning; there is much more to come to Sprout, as we will improve the website in whatever ways that can empower and assist students through the stressful times of high school.
